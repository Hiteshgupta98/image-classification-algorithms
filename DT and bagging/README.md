# Multi-class Image Classification using Decision Tree (DT) and Bagging Algorithms  

DataSet used: Yale B and MNIST dataset

Implemented the DT and bagging algorithms using numpy as the only dependency and performed 5-fold cross-validation to choose the best hyper parameteres. The two algorithms were then tested on both the datasets.
We also implemented pre-pruning on the decision tree algorithm.

## Results:
The model's performance improved with bagging in comparison to a classical DT.
